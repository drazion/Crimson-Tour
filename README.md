Crimson Tour
=========
Author: [drazion]

Crimson Tour is a Javascript Library that allows you to add a web tour tool to your website.  The color scheme is fully customizable.  There are no CSS3 or version dependent components to this tool, although CSS3 is used to style the boxes, the stylings are not required to view the pages. It is the most backwards compatible and lightweight tour library I have encountered thus far.
> Tested and functional in the following browers:
  - FireFox 
  - Chrome
  - Safari
  - Internet Explorer 7, 8, 9

A working example is available at [Crimson Cardinal][1].
